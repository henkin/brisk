# Exercise - ToDo API
## Goals
Create an API for managing a TODO list. The API must be able to manage the creation of a list
as well as the items inside of the list. The basic API design can be found in this swagger
specification. For more information about swagger, please refer to the swagger.io website.

language chosen.
* The candidate may choose to diverge from the swagger specification
* The code must be checked in to a public Github repository.
